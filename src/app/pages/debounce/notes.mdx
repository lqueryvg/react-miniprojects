import { TextLink } from "~/app/_components/TextLink";

- debounce frequently changing values
- _Note: this demo makes little sense on mobile (with no keyboard) since characters are submitted to the input field in batches_
- creates a custom hook `useDebounce()` to debounce values which change frequently
- called as follows:

```
debouncedValue = useDebounce(valueToBeDebounced, delayMilliseconds)
```
