title: "Debounce"
synopsis: "Debounce a text input value which changes frequently"
---

import { TextLink } from "~/app/_components/TextLink";
import { App } from "./App";

"Debouncing" limits how often a function executes. In web UIs, it's used for
rapid-fire events like typing or resizing. Instead of running the function with
every event, it waits until the events stop for a set time, then runs it once.
This prevents excessive processing and improves performance.

## Exercise

- create a custom hook `useDebounce()` which can be used to debounce a values
  which changes frequently
- the hook should be called as follows:

```
debouncedValue = useDebounce(valueToBeDebounced, delayMilliseconds);
```

- demonstrate the hook with a text input field and an output of the debounced
  value

## Example

Below is an example where the "debounced" value is not displayed until the user
stops typing.

_Note: this demo makes little sense on mobile (with no keyboard) since
characters are submitted to the input field in batches_
