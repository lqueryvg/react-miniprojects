import { TextLink } from "~/app/_components/TextLink";
import { App } from "./App";

## Exercise

- create a `<Shop>` where you can add and remove products to/from a shopping
  basket
- `<Products>` and `<Basket>` are children of `<Shop>`
- `<Products>` lists a small number of items each with an "add" button (there
  are no quantities to make things simple)
- `<Basket>` displays items in the basket, each with a "remove" button
- both `<Products>` and `<Basket>` access Zustand state called `BasketStore`
- only `<Basket>` should re-render when the basket changes (not `<Products>`)
  - to see this, enable _Highlight updates when components render_ in {" "}
    <TextLink
      url="https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools"
      text="React Dev Tools"
    />
- `<Shop>` should have no access to the store

Hint: `<Products>` can avoid unnecessary re-renders by only subscribing to the
specific part of the store that it needs, e.g.

```
const addToBasket = useBasketStore((state) => state.addToBasket);
```
