import { TextLink } from "~/app/_components/TextLink";

- `<Products>` and `<Basket>` are child siblings of `<Shop>`
- `<Products>` adds items, `<Basket>` reads and removes items
- both access Zustand state called `BasketStore`{" "}
- only `<Basket>` re-renders when the basket changes
  - to see this, enable _Highlight updates when components render_ in
    {" "}
    <TextLink
      url="https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools"
      text="React Dev Tools"
    />
- `<Shop>` has no access to the store
- `<Products>` avoids unnecessary renders by only subscribing to
  the specific part of the store that it needs, i.e.
  ```
  const addToBasket = useBasketStore((state) => state.addToBasket);
  ```
