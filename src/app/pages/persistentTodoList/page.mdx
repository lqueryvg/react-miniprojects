synopsis: "Todo list persisted in local storage."

import { TextLink } from "~/app/_components/TextLink";
import { App } from "./App";

## Exercise

- create a todo list which is stored in browser local storage, i.e. it is shared
  between tabs and will persist after the tab or browser is closed and re-opened
- display a text input field with an "add" button to enable the user to add new
  items
- use a form to ensure the user enters at least 2 characters
- duplicates should be allowed
- display a list of items in the todo list
  - display a checkbox and a remove button beside each items allowing the user
    to either mark them as completed or delete them
- provide a checkbox to allow the user to simulate errors when adding items
- simulated errors should result in a toast message

## Example

<App />
