title: "MDX"
synopsis: "Display content from an .mdx file."
---

This text demonstrates MDX rendered using styles from Shadcn's Typography. I
come here occasionally during development to check how the theme looks. This
long paragraph demonstrates word wrapping.

- This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.
- `span` with a `className`can be used to colour text
  <span className="text-purple-500">like this </span>
- `code` looks like `this`
- `strong` (bold) looks like <strong>this</strong>
- `em` (emphasis) looks like <em>this</em>
- `a` links look like <a href="#">this</a>
- numbered list:

  1. One
  1. Two
  1. Three

- This paragraph contains a very long word to see what happens to
  veryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryvery
  long words.

- `pre` (preformatted) lines look like this:

  ```
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      todoText: "",
      simulateSubmissionError: false,
    },
  });
  ```

- Scrollable preformatted block:

  ```
  This paragraph contains a very long word to see how word wrap works with
  veryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryvery
  long words.
  ```

- `blockquote` lines look like this:

  > "After all", he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that
  > they should pay for the privilege."
